We moved to London for work so I guess I missed the memo. Unaware, we went for breakfast when we were in town a few weeks ago. As soon as we were seated I ordered my (what I thought was going to be first of many) White Peach Pear Iced Tea. Big smile on my face - London has great hot tea but crap iced tea...you really have to make it yourself usually over here. At any rate - denied. 
Waitress: ""Uh we don't have that any more."" 
Me: (checking the menu in disbelief, mouth agape in horror) ""What?!?"" 
Her: ""Yeah, like, I don't know why they did it...it was really popular."" 
Me: (suspicious it might actually be my own fault given how many refills I always ordered and how often we frequented Turning Point): ""Yeah, doesn't make sense"" 
My husband: (impatient and not trying to be helpful despite whatever he says) ""Just order something else""
Me: (withering glare putting him on notice...thinking that iced tea is the ONLY reason I come to Turning Point so often) ""You order first""

After trial and error I found you CAN order the (available as hot only) White Orchard tea with two accompanying glasses of ice and make your own. But, hell, I might as well be eating breakfast in London slopping the whole table up with tea drippings and condensation.

First thing you see when you walk in is the espresso bar. They have French press options on the menu as well as espresso and the unlimited house coffee options to fill the range of tastes and budgets.

I ordered the huevos rancheros, which came in top of a plate sized tortilla which might have been able to hold itself together as a huge breakfast burrito. If you don't know what huevos rancheros is, think of it as a typical American breakfast of eggs, home fries and sausages (this case chorizo) topped with salsa. In this case they also had a half of an avocado and sour cream. Tasty.

Wife has acai berry crepes which were a special. And we ordered two pancakes for the kid. The pancakes weren't special at all, but they weren't bad.

I had high hopes for this eatery but I got over that with just one visit. Arrived a little after 12p.m. on a perfectly lovely day with four other adult family members. The restaurant makes a nice impression with it's white beadboard trim and large windows. I'm thinking this is going to be nice. We were seated fairly quickly once they had converted a square table to round to accommodate our party of five. The waitress was friendly and attentive at first. Took our orders, poured our beverages etc. Tick, tock, it took 45 minutes before our food was served! If 5 is a big party, they are in big trouble. But the fun doesn't stop there. Out of 5 entrees there were 3 errors. Mom asked for sausage, she got bacon, Sister asked for multi grain bread, she got sour dough, hubby ordered a Tuscany omelet and got a Western. My tuna melt was accurate but miserably cold. Okay let's go with 4 out 5. My brother-in-law was happy with his Cuban. We're still trying to figure out how that happened.

Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.
But whats this? 
There are whispers that he no longer cooks for ""Best Taste of Asia,"" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.

No.
No, it can't be! 
I need to score - one .. final .. hit..

Life ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?
Why am I here?
What is Cheeze Wiz?
Its done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.

Zaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. 

Zaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.
 
I've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.

The menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.
Though some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. 
The head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.

I have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.

The bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for ""Best taste of Asia,"" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. 

Only good things can come of this, only good things.

P.S.
ZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. 
However, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios.

We ordered the veggie samosa, naan, Aloo tikki, lamb vindaloo, and chicken tikka masala.  The veggie samosa and aloo tikki were not flavorful and very bland. It was premade, sitting on the counter, and bagged when I got there to pick them up. They didn't even bothering reheating them before giving them to the customer.  I heated them up when I went home, but they both tasted like bland mashed up potatoes. No spices or flavors that are typical of Indian food. The chicken tikka masala was okay. It is normally my fave dish to order, but the chicken tikka masala here  lacks flavor. It was honestly a bit too red and oily that I was a bit scared to eat it. The lamb vindaloo was the only dish that I enjoyed, but there was barely any lamb. It was mostly sauce and oil, but very nicely spiced. The naan was huge disappointment.

I love squid, and it's always a rare treat when you find a place that serves it grilled instead of deep fried.  I love the concept, but for me the taste of the squid was overpowered by the taste of char from the grill.  When they say grilled, they mean GRILLED.  I used some extra lemon wedges to brighten it up a bit, which definitely helps, but I don't think I'll order that dish again. 

My boyfriend on the other hand, ordered the seafood combination - a tomato/garlic based broth with a ton of seafood.  I had total food envy.   The seafood combination pretty much had it all - shrimp, clams, mussels, tilapia, scallops.. super delicious. Next time, I'm ordering that.

Our appetizer was the shrimp scampi, and it was good, but they lose points for serving shrimp that hadn't been properly cleaned.

First off, I had no idea that this (and the northern Liberties locations) were BYO. I really wished I knew that ahead of time. It's always nice to have a glass of wine with a nice meal right? I was bummed. 

Secondly- the menu at his location was missing the saganaki (fried cheese) that the other now closed location had.

Perhaps my overall disappointment clouds my review but the only thing that stood out was the shrimp pilpil. Outstanding! Everything else was good. But I didn't leave as satisfied as I did at the other Dmitris. 

We ordered the grilled veggies which were good. 
The meatballs were eh. I had to ask what kind of meat they were and please be aware there is veal in them. I don't eat veal. I am
bummed once again. 
Fried calamari platter: needed salt. What the deuce guys?

It was actually one of the worst meals I have had in the 6 years I've lived in Philly. Everything was very bland, like not even seasoned with salt and pepper bland. We ordered the grilled octopus appetizer which was very chewy and tasteless. The only dish that had any seasoning to it was the shrimp pil pil appetizer, which was tasty but nothing all that special.

i recommend grilled scallops and fried calamari.  the reason this place gets 4 stars is because the rice tasted microwaved.  i could make better rice at home.  and the sides were overly cooked greens identical for the calamari and scallops.

When we asked for our table, both hostesses looking at their paper, then said they'd have to go check and would be back. 5 minutes later, they returned and did not acknowledge us. Meanwhile, another large party arrived without a reservation and were told it would be a 40 minute wait. We then heard one hostess say to the other that she didn't want to seat them soon because the kitchen was backed up and people were waiting 40 minutes for their appetizers. So unprofessional.
We walked up again, after they continued to ignore us, and asked about our table. They weren't apologetic when they told us that the girl we spoke to earlier that day was new and never recorded our reservation. They continued to tell us that it would be at least a 20 minute wait before they could put our table together. We got a smug ""I'm sorry, but she was new"" and they brushed us off.

The process: We went for lunch and had to wait a few minutes to be seated for some reason -- not sure why as there were plenty of tables. Another Family in front of mine got seated, then we were seated shortly thereafter. THERE IS A NEW MENU. Server came over and didn't talk about everything being scratch, homemade, etc. so I'm not sure if that somewhat changed with a shift to a new menu, but anyways. We immediately put in an order for our 22 month old daughter so her food could come out immediately. Ordered all soft drinks. Server left to presumably put in her order and drinks and then came back a few minutes later to take our order. She returned about 20 minutes after we ordered to tell us that the soup of the day that was advertised on the chalk boards had run out the night before: 1 in our party changed, the other cancelled their soup order. Server left. Another 20 minutes later, soups came out with the food for my daughter. The hamburger - intentionally ordered with no cheese because of her dairy allergy - came out with unmelted cheese on it. We might have told the server, but she was no where to be found. We removed it ourselves and moved forward. as we got this food, the family that was seated just before us was finished and leaving as we'd already been there for more than 50 minutes for lunch. After finishing up soups - we waited another 30 minutes for lunch. Another member of the staff was working hard to get the entire room refills -- she was great, but where was the food!? We finally got the food person by person - that's to say - 2 of us got food - then 5 minutes later, I got mine, then another 5 minutes later the last person for their food. Mind you 2 of the order were vegetables - 2 chicken -- No idea why the wait was so long. Then when I got mine, my order was completely messed up and I had to wait for the 'helper staff member' to come over for a drink refill to ask for help. She apologized and offered to get a new sandwich on the fly.  She was very helpful and I explained my frustration with this dragged out lunch. At this point the new family -- that took the place of the old family we were seated after -- just finished lunch and was getting ready to leave. 

I got the new sandwich and she shared that no owner nor manager were on at the moment but she would comp my meal because of the inconvenience. 

The Meals: Not one of us (party of 4 + kid) thought our meals had any flavor to them. All bland and the fries were the best part of all meals. 

When the server did come over, we asked for the check and she shared that she had given us 10% off my daughters meal and my meal for the troubles. When we told her what we were told about the meal being comped - she apologized and returned to the POS to do so. We paid cash - gave her the cash asking for change and nearly left because she simply disappeared with it for more than 10 minutes. She finally came back as we were giving up and ready to head for the door. 2 hours 15 minutes later (not including our wait time) we left. 

We all have bad days -- but this was just terrible. An opportunity to have lunch with family from out of town was turned into a frustrating never-ending disappointment.

We called 24 hours in advance and made a reservation for two for the tapan tables for the next evening at 7:30 PM. Upon arriving promptly at 7:30 we were first ignored for 5 to 10 minutes at the door before finally being escorted to our table, where we were seated with two other parties, two couples, one of which was clearly expecting a third person. After waiting for a waitress to arrive to take our order for over 20 minutes, a frowning teenager finally arrived and asked if we were all ready to order. The woman that belonged to the party of three that was still waiting for their third quickly responded that no, she was not ready to order because their third friend had not arrived and the waitress promptly put away her notepad and left the table. WHAT?! Apparently because this group of strangers was not ready to order, the rest of us had to wait to eat. After the third of their party finally arrived at approximately 8PM, half an hour after our reservation time, we were finally able to order. My friend and I chose to order both tapan and sushi, and when the waitress asked if we would like our sushi roll while we were waiting for the chef we said we would. We received no sushi in the next 25 minutes while waiting for the chef to arrive, but rather the roll arrived towards the end of our meal. Overall, the chef was very nice and the food was what I expected of any adequate tapan restaurant. After finishing our meal, we had to beg the waitress several times to finally deliver our check, at this point it was around 9:30PM, we had been at the restaurant for two hours, and were completely exhausted. When she finally delivered it, we were displeased to see that she had charged us full price for our sushi, despite the restaurant's advertisement for half-off sushi during the time we were there.

We made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn't enough chefs, which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill. 

We ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, ""do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!"" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, ""I'm sorry, I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!"" (very politely) He then came back with ""ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind"" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won't, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me, it's hard to always please everyone.

I had dinner here on a Tuesday by myself. I was seated quickly at the sushi bar. I ordered 1 specialty roll and 2 standard rolls. The Mexican roll was excellent. Really, really good!

My tempura roll has no tempura, but the real problem was the seaweed wrappers were so strong and overbearing I could not enjoy the flavor of the fish.  I later realized there was a board of specials and wishes I had ordered off of it. They had some rolls that sounded wonderful.

A bigger issue for me was the service. I was never given water. I was asked to move to make soave for a larger group (this is fine, happy to do it) and while I didn't mind at all, I was never given a dish for my soy sauce in my new seat.

Quick Tip: Crispy Rolls. Enough said.

The service at the sushi bar was great and we had a lot of fun talking and taking our time. The food was more than filling and tasted so fresh. One really learns how bod sushi buffets are when you have fresh sushi for the first time in a long while.

The waitress was always on top of things refilling our drinks and splitting the checks for all 5 of us. Another great aspect about this place is it's location.

Atmosphere: Well this spot has been in SB forevaa. Very large restaurant large square tables with a man throwing knifes in the air and slicing and dicing over a skiddle so hot it spontaneously bursts into flame (how anyone walks away with their eyebrows is a wonder!) We ate at the sushi bar, packed on a Tuesday night like birds on a wire. 

Service: We were quickly seated, and asked to be at the bar. We were not greeted by the men behind the sushi bar, even when we tried to make a simple chit-chat over the sushi (I praised the presentation), there was no return. While the chefs don't have to entertain, I do enjoy when they are present and attentive, which is not the case at this establishment. These guys are dishing out volume of sushi, so this is to be expected.  

Food/drink: The sushi was good. We ate an assortment of rolls that are discounted at a happy hour of sorts. Yellow tail, eel, crab.. it was all tasty. We had a seaweed salad which was mushy as if it had been  soaking in the dressing too long.

Rarely have I ever had a bad experience and I always recommend Something's Fishy to folks from out of town who want a fun experience.  Not only is their sushi the best price in town (half off, all the time) but their hibachi is to die for!  Always, always, always get the fried rice!  My family is completely spoiled because their fried rice is so good.  It doesn't taste as good anywhere else.  Nearly every single hibachi chef I have had does a great job with entertaining, although every now and then (typically during the lunch hour) I have had a chef who is new/learning, so he didn't do as many tricks.  Every now and then a chef will come up with something completely different that I've never seen before, and that's always a treat!

I have had their halibut, chicken, shrimp, and steak and all of it is good.  You can't go wrong.  The best deal you can get is their deluxe filet mignon dinner which comes with miso soup, salad with an amazing ginger dressing, fried rice, grilled vegetables, and mochi ice cream for dessert.  The filet mignon simply melts in your mouth.  Exquisite.

Last time we came here was a NIGHTMARE
- told to wait 30 mins for table
-50 mins later and multiple times checking in to see if we can get seated (empty tables everywhere)
We were seated by the manager
- told we had to wait for the other party of 2 to show up... another 20 mins...
1 hour 40 mins later... we order...
- we get our water 10 mins later and salad 20 mins later 2hours and 10 mins later....we get our food order taken....the CHEF DOES NOT SHOW UP FOR 50 minutes ------- at this point the other party literally leaves- the manager runs after them( as we catch a waiter to ask where our chef is?!?!)

They bring us deep fried crap as a sorry and fresh nice fish to the people who ran out......are you freaking kidding me? (Also we don't eat fried food)

The couple was much older... so wE believe they also judged us by age..

Our chef arrives and does not verify our orders, doesn't say hello or smile.... he seemed exhausted... 

My salmon hibachi was raw and gummy and gross!!!

Steak was good

The kicker!! They attempted to over charge us- when we had already paid!! Said we had to pay more!! I almost wanted to throw their fried tempura at them. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. 

Also we had at least 5 different people come to refill our waters EVERY 2 minutes!!! What is going on in this place?? Management is TERRIBLE!!!

(Brought our local friends here since they had changed from something's fishy- they were so traumatized- said will never be back!)

To make matters worst, they were skimpy on the fillings and the sauce.  Their most expensive roll ($18), which I was looking forward to try, was so bland, all I tasted was soy sauce.  I literally felt I ate a $18 bowl of white rice with soy sauce!!!  The only tasty item was their Eel sushi which was, unfortunately, ruined by long pieces of fine bones.

Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.

Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients.

I read through a few of the reviews before going and wasn't surprised that they were out of the fried chicken when I got there.  I wasn't planning on ordering it anyway but someone in my group tried to.  

I ended up going with the lamb patty melt and while it was good...it wasn't great.  I love having an egg on my sandwich so that was a highlight.  The lamb wasn't that great and it tasted like they combined the lamb meat with some sort of sausage but it don't state so on the menu.   The french fries were good but nothing special.  The lamb stew was the other item I was considering getting so maybe it would be worth going back and trying that.  

If you're a vegetarian you probably want to avoid this place all together because it's not very veggie friendly.  And don't think you can go and order something (like the waffle) without the bacon because your requests for revisions will be ""politely declined"" as it states on the menu.   I like that they tell you ahead of time but it doesn't seem like it would be a terrible thing to request that the cook doesn't sprinkle the bacon on top of the waffle. 

They do have some very interesting drinks and I would consider going there to grab a coffee because the process for coffee seemed to be quite intricate.

Drip coffee was the best coffee I've had for months. Maybe I do need to find something else other than Starbucks. 

Lamb Patty Melt was a little hard to grab so I ate them as a toast + the rest of the sandwich. It has the right amount of lamb flavor and the bread was awesome. So was the fried egg.

Even with all the tables being full there were seats at the bar so we didn't have to wait at all. The cooks are all out in the open so we watched them after we ordered our food. 

The only big complaint I have was the Bloody Mary. It was the one with the raw oyster in it. Oyster was delicious but the drink itself was God awful. Maybe bc I'm used to thicker tomato based bloody Mary's where this one was a carbonated, citrusy beverage. I wasted $10 bc I couldn't even tolerate choking it down. 

Better notes...the food:)
Glazed bacon... Very fatty buuuut thick cuts and the parts we could eat were amazing. 

Pistachio donuts served with a light crème and a few small orange slices were so delicious! They literally melted in your mouth. 

The liege waffle: my favorite item we ordered! Very light and fluffy. Served with whatever syrup was not too sweet and not drenched either. Served with 2 perfectly crunchy pieces of bacon and nuts sprinkled on top of the waffle. So good!

The Viking patti melt: perfectly cooked(a little pink inside) served with crispy French fries. The one and only complaint I had about this was the salt. They add salt onto the patti before they cook it... I would ask them to hold the salt if you decide to order this. I was on the verge of a stomach ache after eating 2 bites of this.

5 hours later... My stomach has been kind of messed up all day. Not sick but just unsettled. I'm on a plane right now so hoping nothing happens.

I have long warranted this spot as a special occasion or celebratory meal but I think that the prices are incredibly accessible. I have never wanted to change anything to a dish I've had here so the complaints of that not being welcome don't ring true for me. 

Everything I have had here has been spectacular. The pastries and bakes goods are to die for. The coffee and concoctions from I believe the only mod bar in indy is superb. The sides are the highlights and the revolving menu never has disappointed. The staff and help are incredibly friendly. Especially the hostess. I salute you milk tooth you make indy a better place.

The atmosphere is super hipster, but there were all kinds of folks dining while we were there.  The restaurant is small but open and great for people watching.  The decor is delightful!- silverware is piled into an old coffee can and there are simple fresh flowers on each table.  

Oh yeah...the FOOD.  The menu is creative and unique.  I love this because I always feel like I could make other brunch places' offerings very easily at home. (Milktooth will take your run-of-the-mill hashbrowns and raise you a crispy potato latke topped with harrisa ketchup and aioli...)  I ordered the cornmeal pancake with fruit, cream, & cinnamon sugar- it satisfied my sweet tooth without being overly rich or heavy.  I paired it with the ricotta whey grits- they were perfectly (very simply) seasoned and very creamy.  Personally, I'm glad that Milktooth's portions aren't huge. I loved being able to select and try more than one menu item for my meal! Sweet + Savory = Success!

I have to say this place is amazing and I don't think my review will be any different than anyone else's.  So I'm just gonna get my complaints out of the way now so I can move on:
1.  You're almost too popular because I had to wait, outside in the rain, for an hour to be seated with my party.  (But I keep a commitment so I did it)
2. I don't like the disorganization of the coffee area or the prices of such. ($4 for a tiny cup? Come on, it's morning and mama needs some energy) also, I was practically shunned for asking for some cream and *gasp* sweetener for my iced coffee.  I'm a lady who knows what she wants and I really try to lay off the suga, so gimme my Splenda packet and we'll be ok.  

On to the good stuff.  Despite how busy they were, service was great.  I almost didn't feel cool enough to be there.  Everyone in their locally made apparel and handlebar mustaches, but I had on my best Hayes & Taylor shirt and crammed myself in anyways.  Of course I tried the bacon.  Do you consider that bacon?  It was half the size of a small pig, but none the less it was delicious!!  I had the pigs in a poncho to eat.  Soooo amazing!  That avocado cream sauce was just the perfect topping and the pickled veggies! I dream about being caught in a rainstorm wearing a poncho like that...

The restaurant is smaller and they have many community tables. We got there just at the right time for a Saturday, 10:30 am. Didn't have to wait for a table. The menu is unique, but for those brunchers who just enjoy simple eggs, toast, and bacon they'll make it. I ordered a Dutch baby with apples and the mocha. The coffee was a good, solid coffee. I was underwhelmed by the Dutch baby. It was good, but not great. Without the apples on top, the 'pancake' itself was very bland. I didn't taste any extra seasoning. I also felt that the $13 for the Dutch baby was a little high. Having made a Dutch baby myself and knowing the ingredients and how easy it is to make, I didn't feel like the $13 was warranted. 
Our service was good and the atmosphere was unique. The place gets very busy around 11, so be sure to plan ahead. It was a neat brunch place and would be a great place to visit when the weather gets nicer as they have outdoor seating.

Especially with Berkeley and Oakland just a hop and a skip away from where I grew up. Knowing that much about me, realize that Milktooth is quite literally the most hipster restaurant that I've ever been to in my life. From everything to the ghetto af music blasting for brunch, the mysteriously facial haired servers, and the quite random and ridiculous decor, everything just screamed hip and markedly cool. So, I was in my element. 

The food here is ridiculous. Their menu is filled with options that you'll read and then go, ""wait wtf those ingredients didn't go together last I checked"", but then you order it and it's so amazingly good and you're left questioning your own existence. Like their Manchengo and Grapfruit dutch baby? It's cheese and grapefruit baked into what's essentially a pancake. Just reading that, it's not supposed to taste good, but what the heck it's so yummy. I don't even get it. Every flavor bounces off each other so divinely that your tongue is left a little cooked after eating here. I'd honestly suggest just ordering together as a group and sharing everything that way you can try as many things as possible.

I personally loved the aesthetic of the restaurant though. It was very obviously a auto shop or a gas station or something of that sort previously; evidenced by the large garage doors adorning one side of the restaurant. Our server was very friendly and helpful when it came to the menu, so an A+ on that end. And the price was right around what I would have expected from a restaurant like this one. 

In all, it was one of the best meals I had on my trip to Indy.

I instantly loved the kitschy decor and airy space. I got the cold brew and it was so refreshing. My friend and I split the grilled cheese, the burger and a grapefruit pastry. It was all so amazing but the grilled cheese was definitely the stand out for me. It was the perfect combination of salty and sweet and unlike anything I've ever tasted although the idea seems so simple. The burger was delicious as well but was missing a little something in the flavor the of patty. The pastry was absolutely perfect and it doesn't hurt that it's citrus season!

I just moved from Philadelphia and was a little worried 'little ole Indy' wouldn't have something to my snuff in the breakfast realm. 

The menu has an exquisite list of unique and/or local ingredients with each item having its own 'flare'. Even a side of bacon doesn't go unnoticed with its extremely thick cut and sorghum syrup. 

I took note of the coffee and appreciated the time and talent that went into each cup. They even serve a cortado.. A sure sign that someone behind the counter has some knowledge of coffee. The latte art I received was also beautiful, as a barista, that's important to me also. The micro foam was on point for my latte and for my husbands cortado. 

Not the place to take someone who just wants scrambled eggs and pancake. Come here to go to another level in the food world and to enjoy the presence of true passion, skill, and knowledge from the chefs and baristas.

Arrived around 12:30 to a very busy restaurant. Was told our wait would be about an hour. Luckily my boyfriend wasn't sure what to order so we spent most of the time getting suggestions and looking at pictures, while enjoying some coffee beverages. After an hour we were seated at the bar and placed our orders. I heard great things about the grilled cheese dish and my boyfriend settled with the Dutch pancake with apples. We ordered a side of bacon as well. 

Once the food came out, I dug in and enjoyed every bit of it. The touch of honey on the grilled cheese really brought the flavor together. I loved having the egg on top as well. The bacon - wow. We couldn't even finish all the bacon but I loved it. We both enjoyed our meals. The items on the menu may seem strange to a first timer, but trust that you will be satisfied with anything, so give it a shot. I would love to come back to try more.

The ambiance definitely gives off a cool vibe. All the way from the great staff to the herb garden in the front. I resisted the urge to call it the good funky.The food is a little different, but not in a bad way. I had the White Bloody Mary and the Uova Al Forno, $12, which is eggs baked in a spicy tomato sauce with amelia's semolina. Fantastic! Just the right amount of spicy. The bloody mary had a couple of unusual ingredients but was refreshing.

I went by myself one Saturday morning which significantly reduced my wait time. Larger parties will likely wait 30 minutes to an hour to be seated. I was seated at the bar by their grill area. This added to my experience as I was able to watch them prepare and plate all of the dishes. The menu is short but full of unfamiliar ingredients, so seeing the process up close demystified a few things.

I started my order with the most pleasantly designed mocha I've ever had. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but I enjoyed the flavor and crafting. For breakfast I had the sorghum-glazed bacon and a sourdough zucchini bread waffle with peaches, orange cream cheese, and a cocoa drizzle. The bacon was so thick it's more resembles pork belly. The saltiness of the bacon went well with the sweetness of my waffle. Zucchini bread is great on it's own, but in waffle form it's even better. It was cooked just like I like, crispy outside and soft inside. All the elements really paired together well.

But I have to say that menu just wasn't doing it for me. There weren't that many options that seemed excited to me personally. Probably because they do a lot of turning a sweet dish into a savory one and that is opposite of what I'm interested in doing. 

I visited around noon on a Thursday and got the last spot in their small parking lot. I opted for sitting at the bar since I was there on my own. I looked over the menu and quickly decided to stick with a basic burger - always a go-to for me. I mentioned to the waitress that they could leave the bun off if they wanted. She informed me that, ""the chef won't make it without a bun"". Which was fine with me, I don't mind simply taking it apart myself. I just feel bad wasting food.

348,1c8dSUDHelxdUyMQrDb8wQ,tBXZIkcFCSgtbnjSDREgpw,EQ-TZ2eeD_E0BHuvoaeG5Q,3,2,1,0,"I had a lot of expectations going into Milktooth based on the reviews I had been reading. I was excited because the concept of a restaurant with an upscale coffee bar was reminiscent of a restaurant (Cafe Medina) that I like to go to in my hometown of Vancouver. I also really liked that they serve several different beans from different roasters.

After eating at Milktooth, I must say that the food was just okay, and the iced coffee that I had was meh, while the regular drip was okay. I don't know if it was quite worth the 45 minute wait. I think my experience was dampened by the flies that kept flying into me, on my food, and drinking from my water glass. At one point, the waitress had come by to ask if everything was okay while a was holding my fork with a fly standing right on it.

I started with an iced vietnamese coffee. I was disappointed by it because it was very weak and watery. The floral flavor of the beans was there, it was the right type of beans and roast, but it was just too weak. I knew this was going to happen because when I was observing the coffee being made, the beans were not packed down enough to allow for the water to steep long enough and have a slower drip. Instead, the water was dripping down too fast into the glass, much like a typical pour over. This process resulted in a coffee whose color was more of an orange than an almost black brown, so when it was actually mixed with the condensed milk, it was almost a vanilla/peach color instead of medium coffee color. This may have been intentional on their part, to get drinks and orders through as quick as possible, but it was probably the worst iced vietnamese coffee I've ever had. It made it the worst because I was expecting my thick, full-bodied, acidic coffee with the richness of the condensed milk and the cooling effect of the ice.

For the food, we had the strawberry shortcake donut holes with whipped goat cheese. This was my favorite, it was definitely good. It made me more open to the idea of ordering more food after my main meal just because I wanted to try more stuff.  However, after I had my okonomiyaki (a favorite treat that I love to eat), and my partner had her Huevos, we did not want to order any more food. Not because we were full, but because we were underwhelmed and feeling like the food we got was overpriced for the quality.  My okonomiyaki was bland. It was missing something. The combination of egg, broken ramen noodles, and calamari really made it bland. I was expecting the bacon to add some flavor, and of course the okonomiyaki sauce and the japanese mayo, but because of the way the bacon was cooked, the full flavor of the bacon did not come through and added to the bland, somewhat fatty taste of the okonomiyaki. Perhaps the okonomiyaki would have benefitted from stronger green onions and some bonito.  As for the Huevos, I can't say much, except my partner commented that it would not have tasted like anything without the salmon, but something about the salmon was actually putting her off it. My partner really liked her mimosa though and said it's the best she's had in a while.

So overall? My experience was okay, a bit underwhelming and based on the food that I received, I thought it was a bit overpriced. Will I come back? I will probably come back for the drinks, and maybe try the tea wings and other pastries.",6/23/2015 21:41,Milktooth,534 Virginia Ave,Indianapolis,IN,46203,39.75916922,-86.14649435,4.0,1379,1,"{'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""'average'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WiFi': ""'free'"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': True, 'breakfast': True}"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'None', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': True, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True'}","Beer, Wine & Spirits, Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Food, Breakfast & Brunch, American (New)","{'Monday': '10:0-15:0', 'Friday': '10:0-15:0', 'Saturday': '10:0-15:0', 'Sunday': '10:0-15:0'}",Restaurant,"lot expectations going Milktooth based reviews reading. excited concept restaurant upscale coffee bar reminiscent restaurant (Cafe Medina) like go hometown Vancouver. also really liked serve several different beans different roasters. eating Milktooth, must say food okay, iced coffee meh, regular drip okay. know quite worth 45 minute wait. think experience dampened flies kept flying me, food, drinking water glass. one point, waitress come ask everything okay holding fork fly standing right it. started iced vietnamese coffee. disappointed weak watery. floral flavor beans there, right type beans roast, weak. knew going happen observing coffee made, beans packed enough allow water steep long enough slower drip.

They opened at 7:00. Our waitress informed us that full breakfast would not be available until 9:00. The music was insanely loud until about 8:30, when they turned it down. We were the only 3 people there for a while, so perhaps the music was up loud for the employees to enjoy? We could barely hear each other talk, and it was way too early for that loud of music for me. The coffee, however, was phenomenal. It was definitely the best, most fresh, and most balanced coffee I have ever had from anywhere. I made plans to stop by on my way to Lilly to grab a coffee some morning. The pastries were very unique. I am not too adventurous when it comes to food, so I'm probably not the best judge of the overall menu, but I really liked the tres leche pastry - bread pudding and beer. Very sweet and lightly tangy. From glancing at the breakfast menu, it was a little weird for my tastes, but again, I am conservative when it comes to food.

As we were seated, we were immediately waited to and served water and more coffee. I don't understand the bad reviews for service here. Our service was fantastic and all of the workers were so nice and informative. 

The food: we got the Apple Dutch baby pancake, blue corn grits, sorghum glazed bacon, and carrot cake waffle. All of the food was exceptional. I read the reviews on the grits, and being that I'm not a huge fan of grits, I was skeptical, but man were these grits good! The pancake was delicious also. I loved the crunch given by the celery and crisp apples on top; however, I do wish it was a bit more sweet. The bacon was probably the best part of our meal, besides the sticky bun:).

I had no idea what to expect; I had only heard the place was good. To be honest, I read through the menu & my first impression was that the place was unnecessarily pretentious. Because I arrived a little later than the breakfast hours, the menu options were not the brunch offerings I had envisioned. I ended up ordering the rye bialy with big eye tuna salad...I really bad no idea what was about to arrive... I mean, what the heck is bialy?

Turns out, bialy is a bagel type bread...who knew? Atop the bialy was the tuna salad, a whipped cream cheese, red onions, salad greens and lots of capers.

In fact although I search on yelp often I have only written two reviews in the past year with Milktooth being one of those two places.  Now prior to reading this review, I'd like to remind you that I lived in New York City as well as Miami so I have tried a lot of different types of restaurants.  

           Even though on a Sunday afternoon the wait was well over an hour it was worth it.  However during that hour wait you're still able to order coffee drinks as well as pastries and enjoy those while awaiting your table.  The backdrop setting for the place is reminiscent of a automobile repair garage shop.  

         As far as the food is concerned we ordered a grilled cheese sandwich which came out with a egg on top as well as syrup.  The honey syrup on top was a perfect blend of sweet and savory.  The bread was cranberry walnuts with a local cheese. The person I was with is not a fan of calamari, but she was willing to give the shrimp and calamari brussel sprout dish a shot and afterwards she said that she would order it again.   

            Overall I had a great experience there and I think anybody within the area absolutely needs to try this restaurant.  I only wish is it was closer to my house, but then I think my pants would eventually not fit me.  As I am proofreading this and revisiting my meal I kind of wish it was open right now :D

I think it's the sexy sorghum glazed bacon, yes, most definitely the bacon and probably the Sweet Tea Fried Chicken and the Dutch Baby Cornmeal Pancake but most definitely the bacon. 

Here's the nitty-gritty:

Space/Ambiance - Open, inviting, and captivating. From the coffee bar to the open concept kitchen ""to the windows to the walls"" there is something magically creative happening here and it's exciting just to sit back and watch. 

Drinks - A wide and vast assortment ranging from artfully presented espresso drinks and pour overs, to cocktails, beer, and wine. I might be so bold to say their latte is one of the best I have had in a long time. The presentation and the addition of Traders Point Creamery milk adds a special local touch. The bottomless house brewed coffee on the other hand was a bit strong for my liking, but wasn't undrinkable, just a bit too rich for me. I have not yet had the pleasure to enjoy one of their cocktails. I do have my eye on the White Bloody Mary. Next time! 

Food - I have tried the Sweet Tea Fried Chicken, Belgian Waffle, Dutch Baby Pancake (sweet variation), Uova AL Forno w/grilled Merguez Sausage, Sorghum Glazed Bacon, and the Chocolate Shortbread. The Sweet Tea Fried Chicken is a great dish and is consistently delicious. The gravy and chicken pair so well together like a perfect harmony. If you order the Uova Al Forno add the Sausage. It definitely adds to the dish bringing in great flavors. I really enjoyed the Dutch Baby Pancake & Belgian Waffle but felt the portion size was small without the addition of a accompaniment from the adjacent menu. This can be good or bad depending on how you look at it. Good if you want to pair a few dishes together but bad if your on a budget.

My Experience - Most recently I decided to share Milktooth with family which included my dad who is the pickiest eater on earth. He simply refuses to eat anything green and sneers at ingredients like pickled avocado and clementine confit. Knowing full well ""modifications are politely declined"" I was a little uneasy and had my fingers crossed that he too would have a pleasant experience. To my amazement the man who hates most food groups loved his Belgian Waffle! Hallelujah there is hope!

Special Notes - I like that you can enjoy a coffee and/or pastry while waiting for your table. It's also nice to be able to get these freshly made items to-go if your short on time.

I almost don't even know why I'm writing a review because what else can possibly be said?! If you live in the state of Indiana and you have not been to Milktooth - GET WITH THE PROGRAM. What's holding you back? The countless amazing reviews? The countless awards? Milktooth literally made it onto a reputable list of top new restaurants IN THE WORLD. Google it. 

So, I had the grilled cheese. Sounds simple and boring, right? Nope. If it were legal, I would seriously consider marrying this thing. It is, hands down, in my top 5 favorite meals EVER. And I love food. I've had lots and lots of food. It's just THAT good. Salty and sweet is my absolute favorite combination, and this meal nails that directly on the head. It's fabulous beyond words. 

The bacon. What to say about the bacon? ALSO AMAZING! It's so thick, and it's covered in this sweet sorghum glaze, and it's the perrrrrrfect consistency/texture, and I just love it. It's basically a huge chunk of salty/sweet meat. Get in my belly. 

The coffee is also superb. Lots of breakfast places serve-up burned coffee simply because it has been sitting in a pot all day. Not cool. 

I can't say that I'm a huuuuge fan of the layout, though. I despise communal eating, and some tables are definitely meant to accommodate multiple parties. This isn't NYC. I'd like to disgustingly devour my bacon meat chunk in solidarity and peace. 

Tip 1) Know that Milktooth is not cheap. My meal (without the bacon and coffee included) was $16, at the time. Whoa! But it's worth it. 

Tip 2) Expect a wait. Even with only 2 people in my party, I've never gotten in without at least a 30 minute wait. But again, it's worth it. 

Tip 3) Order a pastry and some coffee while you wait! Just head on inside to the counter, and order up.

The food was fresh. Pairings were eclectic and I would never imagine to put such ingredients together.

Apparently Milktooth is killing it with rave reviews. It was a no brainer to bookmark this place. This one star review is based solely on the service at Milktooth. The waitresses here were very distant to me and my fiancé. They seemed like they didn't want to be here as they never cracked a smile or a hello. One waitress eyes were very cold and hateful but their service was even colder.  

I had a red eye flight to Indy and I was arriving very early and needed a breakfast spot. This place opens at 7, serving pastries and coffee during this time. Their kitchen opens at 9. 

Me and my fiancé arrived at 8 am on Friday May 6, 2016. We were an hour early for breakfast. We were the second patrons to enter the establishment. So instead of leaving and coming back, we decided to stay for a whole hour.  We proceed to order some drinks and pastries at the bar. The barista was wonderful, attentive, and nice. (Wish the rest of the staff was like this). We took our food to an array of open tables. I had the fresh squeezed orange juice and chocolate croissant. My fiancé had the basil tea and pesto croissant. 

As we waited for 9 am, the Resturant started getting more and more packed. (Remember we were one of the first patrons.) Around 830, one of the waitress came over and asked us if we are staying for breakfast. We said yes and she gave us our menu. We couldn't decide what we wanted, as it was our first time being here. So we were going to ask the waitress what she recommended. Unfortunately no waitress came around to ask if we needed anything, let alone to take our order. My fiancé noticed this and she said, ""are we invisible?"" At 850, The table to our left a waitress comes over and explains the menu to them and takes their order. The table to our right gets a different waitress and places their order. At this moment, i felt mistreated and angry. I wondered why we were being discriminated this way. If MilkTooth didn't want our money why should we stay. We waited for more than an hour to try breakfast and left at 915. 

My first Resturant in Indy in which I was super stoked to try, treated me and my fiancé like we were nothing. I felt very sour for the rest of the day. I really wanted to try the food here and be like the rest of the happy yelpers who gave this place 5 stars.

I just visited Indianapolis for the first time today and searched Yelp for a good coffee joint. Milktooth popped up with a good number of reviews so I decided to check it out. Milktooth is near downtown Indianapolis but it's on the outskirt so street parking was easy to find but they have their own parking lot too. In the parking lot is a little garden which kind of hints at what they believe in as far as food source.  

There is a patio outdoors for eating in the open. Indoors is an urban modern industrial environment which is a new trend in restaurant design. There are tables and bar seating. Behind the counter if the bar area is where the chefs cook up their creations in front of the diners which is neat to watch.  This cooking in the open also lets diners know they are eating clean food and no tricks are pulled behind the kitchen.  

I started with a Pistachio Cream iced coffee which is a mixed drink with espresso, honey, cardamom, pistachio cream, and an orange peel for garnish. The drink was a homerun! I can totally taste all the different flavors in it and it was an incredible experience.  Each tasting note was very distinct and arrived at different times from the start of the sip to the swallow and the aftertaste. Unfortunately this drink is super small and expensive for a coffee at 5.50. Please increase the size of the drink or lower the price a little!

Next I had a dutch baby pancake with sweet lemon mango curd, kiwi, and cashews. This dish was awesome and definitely a good change from the typical american pancakes. The pancake itself had much more flavor than the typical american pancake. The edges had a nice crust for a change in texture. The lemon mango curd had just the right amount of sweetness that would satisfy diners who are not into overly sweet foods like donuts or junk food. The lemon mango curd had a little bit of tanginess in it that lets you know lemon is in it. The kiwi and cashews also complement the dish well. I enjoyed every bite. 

Finally I finished with a mocha. Although the drink may sound simple like a drink you can get at any coffee joint, Milktooth's rendition of the Mocha is unquestionable different, delectable in taste, and visually stunning in appearance. The barista's milk froth art is a work of brilliance like the mona lisa. You have not seen latte art until you've seen Milktooth's latte art. The details in the picture, swirls, lines, and patterns are very intricate and the colors are amazing in contrast. This drink looks too good to drink so i stared and oggled it for quite some time before I took a sip. The artwork remained im form for quite awhile even as I drank away to half the cup and it only lost its image when I was about 90% done. 

Well done Milktooth!!  This is a must visit place and a shining star in the city.

A friend and I met here for lunch today and we were welcomed at the door by a genuinely friendly hostess. There was a bit of a wait so we grabbed a menu. Whoa, OK I am a foodie and will try almost anything. I know many of the culinary terms, etc, but this menu is dizzying. So many unique preparations and melding of flavors it was hard to know what to order.  It wasn't  long before we were seated at the ""bar"" top which we were fine with. From here we could see all the action in the open kitchen. 
I ordered the cvemellia - which was a coffee drink with apple, matcha, pistachio and steamed milk. My first sip was this velvety, smooth, warm, creamy most heavenly fusion of flavor of wonderfulness!!! (Make sure you check out my photo of this drink). As I'm sitting there enjoying my drink a staff member walked up to me and asked me if I liked my drink. He told me it was the first day for this drink on the menu and he was the person who created it. I love it when I get to see the passion behind the artwork. 
My friend and I ordered the sorghum glazed bacon to share and it was gooey, sweet, and perfectly cooked!!
I ordered the grilled Welsh rarebit Dutch baby and my friend the cranberry walnut grilled cheese and we shared. Both of these dishes were journeys in culinary delight. Very different flavors and combinations, but everything was delicious.

I had heard about long waits on the weekends, and so was glad to have a chance to come on a weekday when things were still definitely busy, but a friend and I were able to get a table right away.    

I had a hard time deciding what to eat since so much sounded good, but finally decided on the sweet Dutch baby which now comes served with lemon curd and fresh blackberries, and the sorghum bacon.   Both were amazing!  The lemon and blackberries were so good with the pancake, and I am still thinking about that bacon.   I'm not kidding, A day later, and I am still thinking about that sweet, salty, just right chewy-crisp goodness.   Just order it-trust me.   You'll thank me later.   

The coffees took me a bit to figure out; I am not well versed in all of these trendy brewing techniques.   I opted for the chemex version just to try something totally different and I have to say this was a most excellent cup of coffee.   I usually add cream, but it was not needed!   $4.50 for one cup of coffee is a little pricey, but the caffeine buzz from that one cup seemed equivalent of a few cups, so I really didn't need a refill.  

Service was good; everyone seemed relaxed and moving at a laid back pace, which was fine with us as we were enjoying the food and conversation.   The spread of baked goods on the counter available for take out looked amazing!   I need to stop by on my way to work sometime soon to try something else.   

The price tag for a cup of coffee, pancake and bacon with tax and tip was around $30 for one person, so this is definitely a special treat kind of place, but definitely worth it!",5/31/2015 3:10,Milktooth,534 Virginia Ave,Indianapolis,IN,46203,39.75916922,-86.14649435,4.0,1379,1,"{'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""'average'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WiFi': ""'free'"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': True, 'breakfast': True}"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'None', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': True, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True'}","Beer, Wine & Spirits, Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Food, Breakfast & Brunch, American (New)","{'Monday': '10:0-15:0', 'Friday': '10:0-15:0', 'Saturday': '10:0-15:0', 'Sunday': '10:0-15:0'}",Restaurant,"hearing many good things Milktooth, finally chance visit day work. heard long waits weekends, glad chance come weekday things still definitely busy, friend able get table right away. hard time deciding eat since much sounded good, finally decided sweet Dutch baby comes served lemon curd fresh blackberries, sorghum bacon. amazing! lemon blackberries good pancake, still thinking bacon.

This joint has been on my list for all too long. I recommend ordering several items off of the menu and sharing them with your table. This way you get to try all of the best Milktooth has to offer. 

I started my meal with some caffeine. I am usually a plain coffee kind-of-gal. Give me a dark roast, no cream, no sugar, and I am happy as a clam. However, I had heard the specialty drinks at Milktooth were to die for, so I went ahead and ordered the Cafe Rozata. The cinnamon and orange combination was so perfect. Plus, the drink was a piece of art! You must try it!

Our meal was a combination of three plates the waitress recommended. First, the Maple Bacon. Two thick and juicy slabs of meat that literally melt in your moth. Second, the Sourdough Pecan Sticky Bun. You know how sometimes you eat a cinnamon roll and you just wish there was more of the gooey cinnamon stuff? Well Milktooth went above and beyond. There was so much gooey goodness. Third, the Cherry and Blackberry Dutch Baby Pancake. Who would have thought lime curd sauce on a pancake would work?

The atmosphere was very casual and relaxed, nice for a breakfast and brunch place. The tables weren't too tiny or close together, which I appreciate, and there's also a bar area with seating. The building looks a bit industrial from the road, but once you're inside, it's actually very open and bright. We sat on the shaded patio right next to the entrance, and it was a little strange that some people chose to walk by us on their way out rather than use the door.

The service is probably the only not-so-positive aspect of this place. These are some of the surliest hipsters I have ever encountered. They do their jobs and remember your orders, but they do not look like they care one tiny bit about your actual experience. They asked if everything was okay once we got our food, but I wonder what they would have actually done if I had responded with, ""No."" We came in about a half an hour before closing, so I don't know if they were just annoyed at that, but it's not our fault the restaurant was still open. I'm usually as solid 20% tipper, but I only left our server 15% because of her attitude.

I'm a really picky eater, but, just as everyone says, the food is great. I got a cortado to drink, which wasn't the greatest, but it was certainly good, and I got the sourdough pearl sugar waffle to eat. That thing was delicious. I was initially disappointed at the portion size, but I was surprised to be full after finishing just the one waffle.

I will speak first of the sour cream biscuits and gravy as they were the star of the show even though the menu would lead you to believe they played only a supporting character.  The biscuits were so perfect and had a slight tang from the sour cream that really made them pop.  The gravy though, OMG, was sooooooo good.  It had some sort of extra spice cardamom or something either in the meat or gravy that really made it shine.  Next in awesomeness was the egg.  The humble egg never gets enough love, but when prepared as this was it really is a treat.  Strangely enough the tea-glazed fried chicken played second fiddle to the rest of the meal.  It was decent in it's own right, but just didn't shine like the rest of the meal.

I got an Aeropress coffee and it was pretty tasty.  Next time I may get something a little fancier.

In a retro, hipster grandma's kitchen style environment, you can choose from a savory looking menu of unique and interesting options. To start, I opted for one of the craft lattes which arrived tasting as wonderful as it looked. I was craving something on the sweeter side and ordered the carrot cake waffle to which my taste buds rejoiced: Slight crispness on the outside but flavorful and moist on the inside with just a few dabs of this sweet ""creme cheese like"" frosting on top. To balance this out, I also ordered their latka which arrived with a colorful array of toppings. Out of all three items, this was probably my least favorite choice but nothing to complain about--just a standard potato pancake. 

I don't live in the area but on a warm and sunny day this location would be a beautiful place to sit and relax. With large windows and abundant light, you could spend a few hours here with friends enjoying a delicious brunch.

I started with a Vietnamese iced coffee while waiting for our table (wait was about 40 min for two people on Saturday around noon)...it was good but nothing special. I would definitely consider it to be over priced at $4.50 in a pretty small glass (there were no size options). For my meal, I went for the sweet Dutch baby and my boyfriend opted for the BLT Dutch baby...probably because they were two of the more reasonably priced items. The sweet Dutch baby tasted amazing - the lemon jelly type thing is perfect with the pancake which had a very satisfying chewy texture. Only complaint is that it's literally one pancake with a few pieces of fruit for over $10 and I'm not sure how it was prepared but it doesn't come in a cast iron skillet like I've had at other places. I personally didn't really like the BLT Dutch baby and I thought the presentation/amount of BLT toppings was pretty underwhelming. 

Our waitress was really nice and pretty attentive other than not bringing the cream/sugar we asked for for our drip coffee.

The bacon, eggs and toast in other variations, in my dining companions' dishes, were equally tasty. Milktooth's experimentation is a breath of fresh air that would be welcome anywhere. Coffee was also A+. Venue airy and comfortable. Bartender earnest and handsome. 

On the purported negatives: I'm not sure why a long wait makes a place intrinsically bad, particularly when it has a rare takeaway counter and sunny patio to ease the meanwhile. Personally I saw no evidence of unnecessary pretense: our waitress was actually almost too friendly: smiles all around, hand touching one's shoulder and plenty of sympathy for me when a dish had run out. Anything more would've been cloying.

Lastly, on the refusal to remake dishes without a major ingredient: I completely respect this. The chef has respect for the food s/he is making and so should all of us. Those throwing one-star tantrums need to look at things in perspective: you weren't refused entry, service or an explanation; on the contrary, your waiter discussed other menu options that satisfied your dietary preferences. 

What some critics (e.g. Uroosa) appear to need is more respect for cultural diversity. Much of the world prefers water without ice. Some wait staff don't douse themselves in fragrance. And bacon is a popular breakfast food in the US. Get over it. Sure, some don't eat it for a variety of reasons, and that's why there are other menu options. If you went to Shanghai you wouldn't ask for egg fu yung without pork; you would have fish instead. Much as in Senegal you wouldn't ask for 'no goat' in your mafe bi, nor in India 'no milk' in your chai. Or perhaps YOU would, but it's people like you who are ruining Americans' reputation abroad. Others do things differently and shouldn't have to adjust everything to your limited preferences.

Coffee - fantastic. The cups are smallish but so what, I was offered a cup to go - nice touch. 

Cornmeal pancake - Good but; I thought (my opinion) the dried blueberries detracted from the dish. These are like raisins but sweeter and have a specific flavor that is  overpowering. The dried berries throw the dish off balance. 

Everyone was pleasant but not overly so. I counted 14 people working front and back of house - that's huge. There were maybe 20 customers at the same time.

443,MCMedGQAhKMQ79xipRtBLg,#NAME?,EQ-TZ2eeD_E0BHuvoaeG5Q,2,1,0,0,"After reading pages of glowing reviews and receiving personal recommendations, I was ready to give Milktooth a try, so I decided to take a friend who was visiting from out of town for brunch at this spot. The crowd was large and we assumed the wait time would be long. We were not told an exact wait time by the host, and honestly, it didn't matter; waiting to be seated is an enjoyable component of the brunch experience. We put our names in right after a very nice couple, and we kept an eye on them during the wait to gauge when our time would come. Well, they were sat but we continued to wait. The host would come out into the crowd every few minutes and take patrons to their seats. It was a pretty unconventional method, and made us wonder how he actually remembered the names of each party. Well, after about an hour of waiting my friend who was understandably starving decided to ask about our position in the queue. We were told that we were third in line and would be seated shortly. We continued to wait patiently for another 30 minutes as the host continued to hand pick guests out of the crowd to be seated. We counted at least 6 parties being seated ahead of us - despite us being third in line. It was a little annoying to see fellow customers arrive after us and be seated before us. My friend decided to make one last ditch effort to get us seated before we would just chalk this experience up as a loss and try another spot. We were told by the host (in a pretty condescending tone) that were next in line. The host then began to chastise my friend's impatience by insisting that he told us it would be at least an hour wait (he didn't). 

Trying to put this pretty pathetic pre-meal experience behind us, we tried to get excited about their menu. The menu was not as impressive as I was expecting and the wait staff really did not help navigate the offerings. 

We ended up with dishes that we could both agree were actually very delicious and quality. The problem is that I left Milktooth thinking about their sub-par service, rather than the truly delicious meal. Perhaps this experience will be an outlier amongst the hundreds of positive reviews. I would love to love this place, but I can't see my self returning for a redemption meal anytime soon.",10/3/2016 3:28,Milktooth,534 Virginia Ave,Indianapolis,IN,46203,39.75916922,-86.14649435,4.0,1379,1,"{'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""'average'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WiFi': ""'free'"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': True, 'breakfast': True}"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'None', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': True, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True'}","Beer, Wine & Spirits, Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Food, Breakfast & Brunch, American (New)","{'Monday': '10:0-15:0', 'Friday': '10:0-15:0', 'Saturday': '10:0-15:0', 'Sunday': '10:0-15:0'}",Restaurant,"reading pages glowing reviews receiving personal recommendations, ready give Milktooth try, decided take friend visiting town brunch spot. crowd large assumed wait time would long. told exact wait time host, honestly, matter; waiting seated enjoyable component brunch experience. put names right nice couple, kept eye wait gauge time would come.

I've been to dinner, lunch, and happy hour here all multiple times so I know my way around this place. Before I discuss the many great things about this establishment I'll mention two issues that are less than good.

First this place has an active bar with multiple TVs.  This is great for Happy Hour but not so great if you are seated near it with the intention of having a peaceful meal.  So Rule #1 is to ask to be seated away from the bar.  I've never found this to be a problem as the staff is very accommodating.

Second, in my opinion, the adult libations are generally a dollar or two too high for a mid-level Italian place.  It's very easy to order drinks here that go over $10.  So consider yourself forewarned.

So let's talk about all the positive attributes-

The location is fabulous.  It's within walking distance of Olde City, the Walnut Street Theater, the Historic District, etc., etc.  

The have a few outside tables and Chestnut Street is great for people watching.

These folks have one of the best free parking arrangements in all of Philadelphia.  That's right, I said free and the parking lot is in the same building.  If you are driving in it doesn't get any better than this. Note that free parking is available after 3 PM.  

They use OpenTable so making your reservation is super convenient.  By the way, these folks do a great job during Restaurant Weeks. Make yourself a note to book early for those coveted RW seatings.

Regarding the food; expect classic Italian in large portions.  It doesn't matter if you are a carnivore, like your protein from the sea, or are of the vegetarian persuasion.  Everybody will be happy here.  Expect appetizers to be about $10 and entrées to range from the high teens to mid-twenties. 

The Broccoli Rabe appetizer ($10) is to die for.  It comes with sweet Italian sausage and grilled polenta.  The lovely wife has tried the Chicken Alla Roma ($21) and pronounced it excellent.  It comes with mushrooms and asparagus in a lemon-caper sauce.

I think I found a new go-to happy hour spot in this area. Move aside Sips, these specials happen every Monday through Friday from 4-7. And boy are they are special! 

Their online menu totes the fact that the happy hour food specials are their regular portions at happy hour prices. Just when I was about to quit dining at happy hour because of lame portion sizes, I found a gem.

Looking for a quick bite and drink, my hubby and I split a pizza with meatballs and pepper. I had a glass of merlot and he had citrus flavored vodka with club. The pizza was tasty and could have almost been a meal. Add an appetizer or two to split and there's a regular sized dinner. The pizza came to $7. Wowza!

The bartender was friendly and attentive, even with a full bar.

It's close (which was its main draw) and Italian (who doesn't like Italian food?); yes, LaScala's seemed like the ""safe"" choice.  The decor is fine.  However, with the restaurant barely at capacity, we were originally sat at a wobbly table near the kitchen.  When we asked to move to another location, the hostess looked at me like I had suddenly sprouted some uncontrollable boil smack in the middle of my forehead, uttering, ""Uh, okay.""  Seated at our new table, I barely had 10 seconds to review the menu before we were prompted to order.  Folks, order...or you'll be waiting 10 - 15 minutes until the server comes back again.  We started with the caesar salad and calamari.  Both were decent in taste and portion size.  Our main courses came just as quickly, with one very big exception.  The server put in my entree as raviolis, not veal parmesan with angel hair.  I waited another 15 - 20 minutes for my food.  By the time my food arrived (sans angel hair, just regular spaghetti noodles), my fellow diners were more than half way through their food.  My entree did not blow me away by any means.  The sauce didn't take my breath away (good or bad) either.  On the plus side, the server was extremely apologetic and nice.

We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  Our server was pleasant and attentive.  The food came out quickly (we had a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and entrees) and the spacing between each item was acceptable.  The menu had a nice selection and the specials had prices listed -- yay for that, even though I didn't end up choosing one of those.

My downsides are that the food was just okay.  I had the grilled hanger steak with mushrooms, onions and peppers and while I had requested medium, I think it was a bit overdone and tough.  I don't know much about that particular cut of meat, so perhaps I should have gone more rare (or perhaps it would have been okay if they had cooked it per my order).  It was tasty as far as flavors go otherwise.  My friends and I were also a little peeved at the appetizer.  Honestly, I can't remember what it was and it was good as far as taste goes, but there were three.  And there were four of us.  I think the server should have suggested that we order two appetizers, or talked the kitchen into giving us a fourth serving.  Three is always awkward -- if it's a couple or two couples, someone always either gets the shaft or seems like the aggressive appetizer eater.  Restaurants -- give us even numbers of appetizers!

I work close to this spot and since it had been over a year since my last visit, I decided to try it today for lunch.
I originally ordered the pappardelle with prosciutto and peas. I remembered their pastas being really yummy so I made the decision quickly.
Once it arrived, there was no prosciutto, there were chunks of red onion everywhere and the sauce was bland. It was so bad that I actually asked for a different dish altogether because I couldn't get myself to eat it.
I ordered the penne vodka, which was the dish I ordered in the past that left me the memory of good pasta at this restaurant.... well, that turned into a disappointment as well. There were chunks of what I think was prosciutto in it, which really shouldn't be in a vodka sauce, and the meal overall was just OK.

As usual I'll start with service.

Attentive, engaging and efficient, but some work to do. Enough said?

What makes a restaurant is the menu. Agreed?

For starters, we ordered the broccoli rabe and the eggplant capanata.  It's unusual to describe both in the same way, yet the words ""tender"" and ""flavorful"" come to mind. As we were consumed them, we had to stop at one point and ask ""are we leaving room for dinner?"" That's how good they were.

As for dinner, we were served papperdelle noodles with sausage and bolognese and seafood fraDiavolo. So, I should start with how we finished. Taking half of the dishes home. The portions are huge, and by no means a reflections on flavor. It was true italian in every sense. Might I add my girlfriend is Sicilian (a bit of an expert on the matter). So knowing Italian cuisine, I would say LaScala hits the mark from a taste perspective.

Where a little coaching is needed is in the service area. The server was immature in his approach and presentation. His knowledge of the menu was limited and did not present the best of what LaScala has to offer. It was not bad, by any means, just lacking in enthusiasm.

One certain annoyance is the televisions in the bar area. I believe a restaurant should be exclusive to food, service and atmosphere. Hearing the silly World Series game announcers was simply not a welcomed audible. Why would you have this?

If you venture downtown Philadelphia, especially the Olde City area, I think LaScala is worth the try. 

I'll finish telling you we took half our entree's home (huge portions). We gleefully heated them up the next day for lunch and dug in. Smiles ensued.

For appetizers, the prosciutto wrapped artichokes were the best I've ever had, and my girlfriend's tomato and mozzarella caprese was exceptional. 

For our main entree the salmon over spinach and potatoes was fantastic- fish was cooked perfectly and the accented vegetables went well with the salmon. The gnocchi was always class! Portions were huge- our friend's veal parm was enormous and also delicious!

The cannoli was just ok, but the sundae on the restaurant week menu was delicious. Paired with good coffee and complimentary limoncello (a bit too strong but it was complimentary) it was a great way to end the meal.

Nothing too special. In fact, the calamari had a very fishy taste to it, which was a little unappetizing. The pasta was also just OK.

It was a classy scene that was both family friendly and great for a group of friends. We got seated in a booth next to the window, which was really nice for people watching and enjoying the hustle of the city.

Our waiter was extremely friendly and never rushed us. He came immediately with fresh baked steaming bread and a delicious garlic infused butter oil that was amazing! Probably my favorite part of the night. 

We started with the caprese toast and arugula salad. The caprese tasted fresh, the salad however was slightly disappointing. It tasted bitter and bland at the same time and the dressing just did not highlight the dish. 

For dinner, we split the gnocchi and eggplant ricotta pizza. Both were amazing! The gnocchi was cooked well and the pizza had the perfect combination of flavors.

We ended with homemade tiramisu which was DEVINE!!!! We probably finished it in two minutes. So addicting and so gooooood - you have to order this if nothing else!

My first experience at LaScala's was a very pleasant one.  I was attending a birthday dinner for 25 people.  So I was limited to a preselected menu but everything they brought us was absolutely delicious. 

We were seated in a room off of the main dinning area and even though there were a few different tables, it still seemed like I could conversate with everyone easily.  They had a great wine selection, and another benefit was that on Tuesday nights they have half priced bottles for preselected wines.  A definite plus.

There were 2 servers for our party, they did fantastic.  We had the choice of filet mignon, popsicle lamb chops, and chicken marsala.  Me personally I shared a filet and the lamb chops.  After we all placed our orders, the appetizers just began to flow.  Calamari, stuffed long hots, sausage and peppers, and a house salad with vinaigrette.  Then came the entrees, both the filet and lamb chop popsicle were amazing, they were both served with asparagus and potatoes in various forms (mashed and diced). 

Finally dessert, tiramasu, which everyone seemed to enjoy.  I unfortunately can't stand it for some reason.  However, the servers were nice enough to bring a chocolate chip cannoli.....one of the best I've ever had.

First off, BK Carne Asada and Hotdogs is home of the best Sonoran hotdog in Tucson. 

The only reason there is a so called rivalry between BK and the other guy (gueros) is because of the Travel Channel's Food Wars and they happen to be across the street from each other on 12th ave.

The cabeza was delicious, rich, and fatty, and I wish I had ordered one more.

We are seated promptly and our waitress took our drink and appetizer order.  A short time later,  our drinks and appetizers arrived. The drinks were great and the guac with chips was fantastic.   

Our waitress took our dinner order and we patiently waited for our food.  The waitress checked on us frequently and kept us pretty hydrated.  As time passed,  we noticed that the restaurant was delivering food to tables that were seated after us and even sat new customers after those folks left and feed them too!

We asked our waitress, what's going on with our food? She replied,  ""hasn't the manager been out to talk to you?""  We said, ""no"" and our waitress said, ""I will ask her again to come out and talk to you.""  A short time later, a young lady came out and brought us complimentary guacamole and warm chips and said this is for waiting on the food.  

We waited a long time before we saw our waitress again.  When she came by she asked if we had talked to the manager. After we stated we hadn't, she proceeded to call the manager again and check on our food.

When the manager arrived at our table, it was the same lady who brought the chips and guac! She was very unpleasant and never provided any explanation other than it was busy and the steaks were frozen when we ordered them. Okay...let me apologize for my party ordering the t-bone steaks and for me ordering the cabreria. 

We explained that no one ever mentioned a delay or asked if we wanted to change our order which we could have done hours ago. She pretty much just walked away like no big deal if you are not happy. 

At least lie to me and say you ran out of some main ingredient and had to run to the store. Bring out the food that is ready and feed the antsy children on the table.  Very disappointed with how she handled the situation or I guess how she didn't handle it.

The food finally came out. I would like to give zero stars for the manager but food and micheladas were still great even though it took hours to arrive.

I came in at around 11 am on a Saturday and the place was already starting to fill up. They have fun decorations and place is incredibly clean.

I had the carne asada tacos and asada caramelo. I would only recommend the carmelo if you're a huge fan of plain quesadillas - not much flavor in them even with the meat, but lots of gooey melty cheese between toasty tortilla if you are into that (I know some of you do). The caramelo was ok, but the big winner for me was the carne asada tacos. Although the carne asada comes out looking more like hamburger helper meat rather than freshly chopped chunks of steak, it was pretty darn delicious. Topped with the unlimited salsa verde, fresh cilantro and limes,  fresh guac and pico de gallo, I'm pretty much all set.

They've been consistently busy for the past 6 months or so, with only a table or two empty each time we've gone in. So, obviously, the word is getting out on this place.
The torta was good but, in all honesty, it was not the best I've ever had. It was also a little small compared to others I've had. The meat was fantastic though, of course. I had the pastor, which I think is the best choice for a torta. I also had a carne asada taco which, as always, was fantastic.
Per the service, I've figured it out, I think. When the waiter comes up and takes your drink orders, he/she will be back and, when they come back, you need to order then. Otherwise, you'll be waiting a little while until they come back again. Yeah, that's not much time, but that's just how it is. You'll also likely be asked at least twice by different people about what you want to drink. Don't take offense, they're just trying to be efficient. Food often comes out super-quick because they have most of the meats made already. I don't blame them on that one though, of course. I mean, have you ever asada-d your own carne? Takes a while.
I've also determined that they are hell-bent on not giving me corn tortillas for my tacos. Third time I've been given flour after asking. Hey, that's okay though.
Another weird thing: on this last visit, I noticed on the ticket that the server's listed name was ""Mercado."" Eh? Maybe just what they give all tickets.
Another cool thing: you get free refills on aguas frescas, including horchata. Damn, that stuff is sugary though. Get your insulin ready.
Torta + taco + large caramelo (that my companion ordered) = $11.40 w/ tax. Not bad at all. Plus, we were in there less than 30 minutes even though they were busy.

It seems like the reviews here are either 5 stars, or 1-2. I don't know if there's a big inconsistency with what staff is working. All I know is the food is always good when I've eaten there. The service is sometimes a little slow, but I won't really hold that against then, as it only happens when they're slammed with customers. The staff have always been extremely friendly, and even when they're busy and the service is a little slow, it seems obvious to me that they're all really trying to do the best they can.

551,2eHj0Pe6gmFI0p5YJBLDog,P-7VidyXqOGd6zBnT85pDA,otQS34_MymijPTdNBoBdCw,5,0,0,0,"I can't really say enough good things about BK's northern location. If you want the prices and quality of a good taqueria, but want a nicer sit down atmosphere with table service, I don't think that you can find a better place.
BK's is famous for their Sonoran dogs now, but their other food is just as fantastic, if not better. I would submit that they have some of the best carne asada in town. Cheap too. Tacos run $1.50 (cheaper than Nico's even), and not just for the asada ones: their pastor meat is also fantastic and runs at the same price. Great tortillas and they come loaded with meat.
A favorite of mine is also the caramelo, usually the carne asada one (I think the pastor tastes funny with all that cheese). They have a small and large size, but only the small comes with the corn tortilla option. Personally, I like their corn tortillas better.
As far as the dogs go, they run $2.50 per and come with a nice grilled pepper. They have a condiment bar that includes two kinds of cheese, guacamole, red salsa, green salsa, cucumbers, avocado sauce, radishes, etc., etc. That alone should make this a higher-end place but, like I said, it's really very cheap.
The service is always really nice too. They'll take your order at your table, refill your waters, even pick up your check when you're done. The servers always do a good job.
Honestly, I haven't tried the majority of the items on the BK menu, just because I can't get past my standards. If I go, I have to get a hot dog and a carne asada taco or caramelo. If I don't get those, I'm always left with a ""What if?"" in my mind.

I went in today for lunch and ordered the Sonoran Hot Dog, a pastor taco on flour, and a michelada w/ modelo especial beer (imagine a bloody mary w/ beer and 10x better). I've had the carne asada before but I just felt like my lunch needed a little more flavor so I went with the pastor which is similar but just marinated. The pastor taco I got today was different from when ive ordered it before. They added a little pineapple salsa and I couldn't get enough! The saltiness from the marinade and the sweet and tartness from the pineapple was perfectly balanced in every bite. It reminded me of a little taste of paradise, I was in heaven. I wasn't very impressed with the hot dog today, I got it with everything and flavors just fell short.

I spit it out, put it on a napkin, let the waitress know. She nodded,quickly left the table, and never came back.

I stopped in on a recent visit after hearing many argue they were as good as El Guero, which has been my go-to since the Sonoran Hot Dog thing exploded in the Dirty. Let's just say I was pretty impressed. While I still like El Guero, here's why BK gets my vote:

1. They offer a cool mix of to-go (with a drive through) or full service with a full bar, which El Guero does not. I had THE BEST Michelada I've ever had there. Amazing.

2. Their ""accoutrement"" bar is more expansive, with grilled green onions, yellow chilis, and myriad other toppings.

3. They have a bunch of other good items on their menu. Their Carne Asada was amazing. I also had a quesadilla and one of their ""Toritos"", a ham and cheese stuffed, bacon-wrapped grilled pepper. Oh yes they did.

I honestly can't say their dogs were much different-- Perhaps I'll have to give them the Pepsi challenge back to back with El Guero's, but they're really, really good.

Who does that? I do! They taste like steak and mesquite as well and come on a toasty sesame seed bun with a lot of sesames and you can load it up with the Mexican toppings and make your own fusion burger.

Or like me and my homegirl, are you looking some big ass tacos at about 10pm on a Friday night? Look no further. I definitely dug the divey atmosphere with a menu full of your tex mex favorites along with hot dogs. Say what?

Their salsa bar was large and had some odd toppings. It took me a hot second to comprehend why the hell a salsa bar had mustard and shredded cheese, but then it dawned on me... the Sonoran hot dog. This isn't your average salsa bar, because it also happens to be a hot dog bar.

I went for the al pastor and the chicken tacos and I've had better. They were large, but super greasy. The guac was extremely creamy, but definitely didn't taste the freshest and it was that dark green hue that comes from maybe some of the avocados a little past their prime. It was also topped with like a parmesan style cheese which didn't help. 

The sonoran hot dog? A few bites, but it was more bread than dog. Womp womp.
The margarita? Sugary, but strong!

The food we ordered was a steak sandwich and I had a club...   The sandwich itself was fine.. Nothing great.. nothing bad...

I ate one.

The togo ketchup they gave us must have been 5 years old or more..  How did I know?  It came out black!  

The coleslaw they served was awful..  It was just tainted and not good.

The staff is super great ! Quick to take orders and whip them up.  I saw them walking around cleaning multiple times.

It hasn't happened yet but someone opened one up in Washington West which is totally not fair since Good Karma is an easy walk from the awesomeness of Chapterhouse.

I'll forestall my bitterness for now and just be glad that I can stop walking a whole two blocks than before if I really must be at a coffeehouse that much sooner. Good Karma is BIG and bright and has a lot of outlets and WiFi. There's a large selection of baked good and drinks other than coffee and tea. That's cool. They have two nice bathrooms, too, and no one bothers you and they're open late. Could this be coffeehouse love?

The downsides are the food's not great. There's a sign telling you not to bring food from elsewhere which I must respect but I must admit to being a little sad inside when I have to bite into one of their moist, overly eggy scones knowing there are great ones out there made by our own Metropolitan Bakery. The coffee's fine, as far as a brew is concerned but as a fellow Yelper said, the lattes leave much to be desired. They're confused as to what makes a latte and what makes a cappuccino. I ordered one once and none since. 

But what can I say. I'll take the bad scones and indifferent coffee drinks for the genuine friendliness of the place and my face is as green as their mugs when I think about how spoiled that neighborhood is while my part of town is totally bereft of coffeehouse awesomeness.

Second: The service is good...when you're there. There was one Saturday morning when I called hoping to just order a grab and go before a morning tee time and the girl who picked up said they don't do takeout orders on the weekends. Before I could ask if she meant over the phone or at all (walking there and ordering was still an option for me), she had already hung up. Didn't even say bye so I kind of just kept talking until the line went dead (oops). 

Third: The food is serviceable, I guess. I don't think most people go here for dinner plans but eat when they're hungry in the middle of getting some work done. For that reason, it's a solid food place. I typically have the bagel and lox, though, hard to screw that up.

The cafe options for good coffee are sparse between the Washington Square neighborhood and center city (and I had grown tired of looking at the empty Ethnics space), the Good Karma Cafe is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  

I ordered an iced coffee - its good to know they come in two sizes - 16 and 20 oz, along with a shot of espresso (at no additional charge), and that they also carry soy milk.  I decided to sit down with a magazine and my coffee and take in the atmosphere of the new space- its very open and still feels a bit empty- somewhat lacking the cozy atmosphere that makes a cafe seem so inviting.  I went to take a seat in the side room towards the back of the space, but the air felt a bit stuffy there so moved towards the front.  The music added a nice chilled out vibe, and the large paintings added some color to the otherwise white walls.  

The space up front near the counter is a bit barren, with the exception of two not-so-pretty drink coolers- it would be nice to see more tables here, or a counter with some stools.  There is also an atm inside, nice I suppose if you need a bit of extra cash (not sure if the cafe takes cards)...however, it would be nicer if the sound on the machine could be turned off- it beeps loudly every time a button is pressed- kind of distracting if you are reading or studying. Additionally, with the size of the space, before they opened, I was expecting more of a cafe- the kind that serves soups and sandwiches, in addition to coffee, tea etc., maybe this will happen eventually?  It would really be nice to have a quick sandwich/snack option in the neighborhood.

All things aside, I know they've only been open for about a week and a half and are still getting used to the new space, so I'll definitely return.",10/11/2010 16:06,Good Karma Cafe,928 Pine St,Philadelphia,PA,19107,39.9446092,-75.1578331,4.0,249,1,"{'Alcohol': ""u'none'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '1', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'""}","Food, Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants","{'Monday': '7:0-17:0', 'Tuesday': '7:0-17:0', 'Wednesday': '7:0-17:0', 'Thursday': '7:0-17:0', 'Friday': '7:0-17:0', 'Saturday': '7:0-17:0', 'Sunday': '7:0-17:0'}",Restaurant,"review newly opened second location Pine Street 9th 10th street. stopped morning check coffee here. cafe options good coffee sparse Washington Square neighborhood center city (and grown tired looking empty Ethnics space), Good Karma Cafe welcome addition neighborhood. ordered iced coffee - good know come two sizes - 16 20 oz, along shot espresso (at additional charge), also carry soy milk. decided sit magazine coffee take atmosphere new space- open still feels bit empty- somewhat lacking cozy atmosphere makes cafe seem inviting. went take seat side room towards back space, air felt bit stuffy moved towards front. music added nice chilled vibe, large paintings added color otherwise white walls. space front near counter bit barren, exception two not-so-pretty drink coolers- would nice see tables here, counter stools. also atm inside, nice suppose need bit extra cash (not sure cafe takes cards)...however, would nicer sound machine could turned off- beeps loudly every time button pressed- kind distracting reading studying.

I typically sit at a large table in the back although sometimes it's too busy and I'm stuck at a small table (I like to spread things out).

Really love the ambiance- they've remodeled in the past couple years and it looks nice! 

The sushi itself is great- it's consistently tasty and the fish is fresh and delicious.  If you're craving sushi, this is the place to go! Also, they have some really unique rolls (my favorite is the Orange Dragon... YUM!!) and the prices are decent!

As for the teriyaki and non-sushi dishes, they are great as well. The only thing is every once in a while the chicken is a little over cooked and crispy... kind of a bummer.  Overall, the portions are BIG and very satisfying.

We walked in tonight and the place is empty. It smells like the restroom.
I have been in the restaurant biz for over 20 years. I am used to seeing a certain flow and the way the staff  go about their jobs is so disorganized. This place is obviously not well managed as the inexperienced staff have no training They make each staff member independent of each other so that on any given night you can have three servers come and ask to take your order. On the ticket, instead of a server's name, it just says ""manager."" The servers are mostly indifferent. They will bring out the food without concern for who ordered it, if the patrons have basic utensils, etc. I often order miso soup and 9 times out of 10 the server carries it in hand with their thumb on the rim. Many people sip from the rim of this kind of bowl. They usually forget to bring something ordered.
One can go to Vons and get just about anything that tastes fresher. If you like frozen beef or chicken that is heated in a microwave and smothered with store bought teriyaki goop, then this place is for you! The sushi looks authentic but for me, the success of a sushi restaurant is freshness of the seafood. They use the lowest grade of fish and the color, odor and taste is not what one sees in a good sushi restaurant.
The staff spend an inordinate amount of time doing side-work (consolidating soy sauce) instead of paying attention to customers.

To start off, when we first got into the restaurant we were. It greeted or asked to sit anywhere and we ended up seating ourselves. Then to make matters even worst it took them 20 minutes to realize we didn't have menus or drinks yet. We put in our orders for some pretty simple food items. The first waiter was not accurate with our order and messed our drink orders up and who knows when he put our rolls in because we didn't receive them until we had to persistently ask for them which took about 45 minutes. Soon after we put in our meal order and that came out 20 minutes later which was fine thanks to the lady who waited on us after we called for her because no one was helping us, which by the way I wish I asked for her name because she was the only helpful one and got our order and meals out at a reasonable time. Our first waiter disappeared on us literally like went M.I.A. But the overall experience was the worst ever!! The male waiters just stood around and didn't even bother coming to ask how everything was or if we needed anything, but the female waitress was by far very helpful and respectful. To sum everything up our food came an hour after we had put in our orders while people around us were eating, enjoying their meals even though we came before! At the end of our meal the first male waiter finally returned out of the nowhere and gave us the bill for which he didn't even have any business in because he left us hanging.

Being by myself I just sat down at the sushi bar and simply asked the sushi chef for recommendations. He highly recommended the halibut and yellow tuna that evening so I started with 2 pieces of Nigiri with the Halibut. It was so incredibly good and I wish I could remember the name of the sauce he drizzled on it. It was just divine.

I then asked for a recommendation on a roll with tuna and / or salmon and he high recommended the Crunchy Roll. Salmon, Tuna, Cream Cheese, rice and then dropped into a fryer. Sliced and served with a nice stacked presentation.

The salmon looked so amazing in the glass, I decided to finish off with 2 more pieces of Nigiri with the Salmon. Again, excellent. As I sat there I watched the chefs prepare multiple rolls and each looked awesome. The entire meal was much more reasonable than I expected.

The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.
My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea.

She asked if I had been there before and I told her I hadn't. She explained the menu and handed me the order forms to make my own sushi roll or sushi bowl. She also showed me the menu with sushi and the sushi bowls with the combinations they already had. This was the hardest decision of my day! 

I decided on the Korean BBQ Beef bowl on the menu with white rice. The food was fresh and tasted good. Now I do have the confess I don't like carrots so I threw them all out so my sushi bowl was more like BBQ Beef bowl. 

The restaurant its self was nice and clean. There were some tables to dine in and there was seating in the window on stools. I ended up visiting the restrooms and they were clean and smelled good.

Not only were the ribs some of the best fall-off-the-bone ribs I've ever had, they were very reasonably priced. We had a great waitress who handled all 19 of our food and drink orders and nobody had to wait for a refill on their drink. 

One side note, the place had various sizes of pig statues in all the windows. I asked our waitress if the owner would consider selling me a small one.

Did I mention that their sauces are amazing? My guilty pleasure is to put each sauce on each potato chip.

We tried the pulled pork, the brisket and ribs and all were great.  The sides were good, especially the mac and cheese, and the wife had a dessert, which she liked a lot.  The service was efficient and friendly.  

Ok, if everything is so good, why only 3 stars?  There are a lot of things that keep this from being a 4 star place.  First, if you are charging $16 for a plate of barbecue, you shouldn't be serving your sides in little plastic cups.  This makes it looks like you are doing this on the cheap.  Invest in some small cups or ramekins.  Second, if a bar is going to be a major component of your seating, you definitely need a foot rail.  I'm guessing the owners have never owned a bar before, but this is the difference between 10 extra seats for dinner and 0.  Finally, one last thing:  BEER!.  It is great that the place has jumped on to the local craft brew wagon, and the 6 beers they had on draft were nice, but when you are serving local beers, you need a list or other description to explain what they are.  Simply putting the name on a board will not be sufficient for folks that aren't familiar with the choices.  (Especially on a board with dark blue writing on black).

We tried the pick 4 platter with a pork chop, brisket, sausage, and rib tips. I was not dissappointed in the meats. They were all tender, well smoked, and seasoned nicely. The corn bread and green bean sides were goods as well. 

My FAVOURITE part...were the adult beverages. Let me tell you, the smoked ice option is the only way to fly. An old fashioned with smoked ice brings the drink to a WHOLE other level. It adds so much depth and complexity. Let's just say I need to go back. Also the value for the big pours you get here is incredible.

The only downfall was the service.  A couple at another table were complaining about the service when we sat next to them, so we were prepared.  It wasn't bad enough to keep us from coming back, but we will only return when we know we have extra time to spare.

I'd like to rank it higher, since we had OUTSTANDING service (Jojo is great!) and because the place is cute...but I found the food to be ""meh."" (Admittedly, I have high expectations for BBQ.)

Perks: this place obviously seasons & crafts their own food and they don't pre-sauce the meat, which is good (why do so many places in Indiana pre-sauce?) The service was GREAT.  The drink menu was impressive. The fried cabbage was pretty good, although probably greasier than necessary.

Downsides: the pulled pork & brisket both tasted like they had been dunked in a salty broth/brine & held warm in it. The texture also was similar to meat held warm in a crockpot, instead of freshly sliced/pulled bbq.  There was a lack of visible smoke-ring on our pork & brisket, and a total lack of yummy bark.

First, the glaring ""help wanted"" sign on the door was only more evident by the 3 different, hurried servers we had, one of them rather rude who just passed us off to any help she could find. Others were fine but clearly understaffed for a Friday. So, servers and bartenders: please apply!
If bourbon is literally in your name, a selection with more depth, or description for curious imbibers would make sense. Also, post it at the table as its own menu, or educate the servers better, I had to squint at the wall then basically toss a dart. Also, chipped, or small cubed ice scooped into a random cocktail glass rather than a whiskey tumbler is just a no-no IMO.
The BBQ wasn't bad, wasn't great either, but I have great respect for the process of refining the craft. The brisket and the ribs were just a bit dry, some sections resembled jerky more than juicy, tender bbq. Pulled chicken way too salty, not sure how. Also, expected *baked* mac n cheese, not a cup of creamy regular stuff. However, the fried cabbage was a great highlight.
The cost was far more than I'm used to, I also noticed that the prices photo'd here have since increased in a short period of time. I didn't expect to pay almost $50 for 2 dinners, 2 drinks.
Finally, what killed it for me was the karaoke, I personally despise karaoke, anywhere, ever. On a busy Friday night at a place like this I'd expect some live blues, or at least just crank some relevant music rather than some stranger's selection of off-key progressive rock ballads. Brought the ambiance down a few notches.
I have faith in bbq joints finding the right recipe for business, I really hope they stay dedicated to their name and continue to improve, tons of potential here. 3 generous stars for the effort, 2 very difficult ones to go.

Because I learned they allow BYOB, I brought over some beers from the Giant in the same shopping strip.

I ordered the vegetable spring rolls and shrimp pad thai.

The spring rolls come out hot out of the fryer. They are sliced at an angle, which allows more of the aroma of the filling to waft up to one's nose.

The crust was pleasantly golden, both slightly oily and crisp. The interior of the roll was slightly mushy (not quite perfect.) But the mix of vegetables was savoury and generous in portion.

The accompanying sweet and sour dipping sauce added a needed element of acid to an otherwise very umami forward flavor profile.

The Shrimp Pad Thai was portioned very generously. The noodles were well executed, firm yet soft on the bite. The dish had a powerful flavor blend of fishiness, savouriness, and sweet. The nuts inside were just crunchy enough to add an interesting mouthfeel. 

The shrimp was slightly over cooked and presented a noticeable but subtle mushiness. 

Overall the dish was filling and more interesting in flavor than in texture, which was quite homogeneous. The noodles really did an excellent job absorbing the pad thai sauce.",2/24/2018 15:12,Thai Place Restaurant,"700 Nutt Rd, Ste 730",Phoenixville,PA,19460,40.13263469,-75.5332256,4.5,222,1,"{'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'BYOBCorkage': ""'yes_free'"", 'Alcohol': ""'none'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': False, u'classy': False, u'upscale': False}"", 'BusinessParking': 'None', 'GoodForMeal': ""{u'breakfast': False, u'brunch': False, u'lunch': None, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': False, u'dessert': False}""}","Thai, Restaurants","{'Tuesday': '17:0-21:30', 'Wednesday': '17:0-21:30', 'Thursday': '17:0-21:30', 'Friday': '17:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '17:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '17:0-21:0'}",Restaurant,"Crisp vegetables spring rolls sweet savoury pad thai well executed noodles.

We never ate inside, but have been inside numerous times to pickup our food. It is located in a strip mall, however once you get inside it is beautifully and authentically decorated.  I actually am not quite sure why we never ate inside... 

I have eaten a variety of curries and noodle dishes here. We also occaisonally get the shrimp and pineapple fried rice, which is delicious. All of the vegetables are fresh and crisp in their sauces, no frozen and rethawed veggies here! In the curries with basil in them, it is actual strips of leaf, not dried and powdered, or even dried. This restaurant takes pride in their food and don't serve anything they wouldn't eat. We have also had some of the appetizers here, which tend toward deep-fat-fried chinese apps. Eh, I'd rather have an extra entree of their delicious specialties! My personal favorites are the Drunken Noodles, and yellow and massamun curries, medium--hot.

757,cu0CG7y1UkJuchCP_RByGg,#NAME?,x4XdNhp0Xn8lOivzc77J-g,4,7,3,3,"Rolling in from Westmoreland County on the Pa Pike, my stomach started growling after almost four hours on the road.  I was near exit 312.  I pulled out my trusty sidekick Mobile Yelp and dialed in ""Thai Restaurant.""  It came back with two choices in the vicinity, so I opted for the one nearer my location.

Thai Place has an unassuming name, but under its self deprecating identity lurks a very fine Thai kitchen and comfortable dining space turning out very good authentic grub. Where many other restos of this genre approach the atmospherics with dark wood and musty scents, this shop is bright, light, and airy.  The owner works the front of the house enthusiastically, while the single server on the floor managed a warm smile and genuine concern for all the patrons. 

I ordered the Tom Yum Soup (Vegetables) and Drunken Noodles (Chicken).  Both were excellent.  They asked my preferred spice level between 1 and 3, and I asked for max spice.  That's the way I got it, right at the point where my sinuses start to run. Love it!  There were plenty of Veggies and Tofu in the soup, and even more in the Drunken Noodles.  There was enough for dinner the next night.  

The only reason Thai Place did not reach the apex was that my Jasmine Tea arrived in a lovely lime green mug with a teabag, rather than a pot of brewing boiling water and loose tea leaves.  That is the best way to achieve full bodied flavor, and requires fewer return visits to refill the mug with hot water.  I get that good tea is expensive and often unappreciated, but for me it sets apart the very good from the superlative.",10/30/2014 17:04,Thai Place Restaurant,"700 Nutt Rd, Ste 730",Phoenixville,PA,19460,40.13263469,-75.5332256,4.5,222,1,"{'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'BYOBCorkage': ""'yes_free'"", 'Alcohol': ""'none'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': False, u'classy': False, u'upscale': False}"", 'BusinessParking': 'None', 'GoodForMeal': ""{u'breakfast': False, u'brunch': False, u'lunch': None, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': False, u'dessert': False}""}","Thai, Restaurants","{'Tuesday': '17:0-21:30', 'Wednesday': '17:0-21:30', 'Thursday': '17:0-21:30', 'Friday': '17:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '17:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '17:0-21:0'}",Restaurant,"Rolling Westmoreland County Pa Pike, stomach started growling almost four hours road. near exit 312. pulled trusty sidekick Mobile Yelp dialed ""Thai Restaurant."" came back two choices vicinity, opted one nearer location.

We haven't been impressed with restaurants in this area, but we like Thai Place.  We've come here a few times, so its easy for me to give 5 stars.

You can tell Thai Place pays attention to the details. The decor, general presentation of food, and the fact the thai iced tea comes with a straw wrapper twisted into a cute origami :) Also, the staff are friendly, and the prices are reasonable, especially for the quality of food. 

The one concern I have about Thai food in general is the grease level. But the food at Thai Place has consistently been not greasy, even the fried foods, and quite flavorful. 

The last time we came here, we had fried taro root, vegetarian pad thai, and vegetarian green curry.  I'd recommend all those dishes.  The vegetarian pad thai was delicious.

Especially considering the location in east bumble f, pa. that being said, i'm astounded that this is rated so highly. It wasn't a horrible experience, but no way is it a 4.5 star rating.  I guess I need to consider the raters when considering the opinions.

Anyway, stopped in for a lunch special. Approx $8 and change for an appetizer, soup or salad, and an entree. The pricing was fair and it was a pretty big lunch menu to select from. For an appetizer, i went with chicken satay, my soup was a something tom kah coconut soup, and my entree was a penang curry.

The chicken satay and soup came out together. The chicken was bbq'd a bit too much, being a little bit drier than I prefered, but it was slathered in what tasted like a satay sauce from a can. No joke, I think I have the same kung lee or whatever brand of satay dressing in my fridge right now. I would pass on the chicken satay. The soup came out looking nice. there were big slices of chicken, onions, and a single slice of tomato. The onions were all under cooked and a bit sharp, maybe this was their intent, but they were cut too large so it wasn't an easy task to align it with the spoon direction to be able to fit it in my mouth with the soup (that's what she said, freak). The soup also had a bit of a sour taste, not exactly to my liking either.

The entree came in a small bowl, cause it's a soupy curry, with a bowl shaped mound of rice. It looked so bare on the plate, i had to check to make sure they didn't forget the rest of the meal. Surprisingly, it was pretty filling, thank you mr. rice. Um.. all i could say was that the curry had salt, a bit too much. I think the chef mixed the ingredients up, instead of sugar he added salt. Instead of curry powder, salt! Salt salt salt! I had to dump all the rice in to soak up the curry and balance out the flavor to make it more palatable.

Our decision to dine here was largely based on the fact that it was pouring raining and this restaurant is next door to our hotel. We started with the bacon garlic oysters and jumbo buffalo wings. The bacon garlic oysters were average, at best. The oysters were overpowered by the cheese and bacon, which was disappointing. The buffalo wings were pretty good and seasoned well. For entrees, we ordered: 1) jumbalaya pasta, 2) blackened red fish and 3) canal street red fish. The jumbalaya pasta lacked flavor and was our least favorite (would not order again). The blackened red fish was just okay and the skimpy side of sautéed veggies (spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms) were VERY salty (would order again as a LAST resort). The canal street red fish wasn't great but my friend would order it again. Her biggest complaint was that it had very little garlic sauce. We also ordered paddle boat drinks, which tasted good but were more juice vs alcohol (had to order an extra shot).

 I had to walk to the bar and ask for my scotch on the rocks and there it was still sit there ..all water down.. the bartender gave it to me.
 I went to my table another waiter came up... I told her about it she said she'd bring me another one then I ordered a dozen fresh oysters on the half shell which are supposed to be on ice and freezing cold. Not so at this place okay no problem.. let's move on.. ordered a grilled chicken salad the chicken was so dry seem like it was sitting there for 4 days you needed a gallon of water to push down one strip. Finally we ordered the bread pudding..  I've had a thousand of them this one was definitely the worst so needless to say no need to go back here again

We had a group of ~15 walk up during [non-peak] lunch time and didn't have to wait anytime for them to push tables together for us to sit down. I let the hostess & waiters know we were on a time crunch and they all nodded and understood. As a group, we all maybe took just a few minutes to review the menu and order. I also asked the staff to print checks once the food came out so we could pay. Unfortunately this info must've not passed thru to other people in the restaurant because in the end, a bunch of us were late for the after-lunch seminar due to waiting for food, checks, & change. Again, a little pricy for what I ordered but I'm guessing this is just part of visiting Nola. 

The food though was amaaaazing for what I ordered [Crab Cakes & lunch Crawfish Etouffée] and tried from someone else's plate [a seafood etoufee dish with crab].

Crawfish Cakes: DELICIOUS. Whatever that sauce was, it was asking to be licked off of the plate.

Bacon Garlic Oysters: MY GAWD. These things are addicting. I had to stop myself from ordering more. They were FRESHLY chargrilled, like you couldn't just pick them up off the plate. They were literally piping hot and ridiculously amazing.

Entrees:
Taste of the Bayou (Crawfish Etouffee/Red Beans & Rice/Jambalaya): All were VERY good, but the star of this plate was the Etouffee. The flavors blended so well, and the seasoning was spot on. no hot sauce needed. The jambalaya needed a few drops, but it was good as well. Red Beans, better than anything in California.

Shrimp and Grits: I NEVER finish plates at restaurants (I am the to go box queen) but this plate? I scraped it clean. The gouda grits were decedent, rich, flavorful. The shrimp were fresh and plentiful. The cherry tomatoes were the perfect garnish. I was completely blown away by the complexity of the flavors.

I booked with this venue in the beginning of my engagement after meeting with Pat. He spent the entire meeting discussing all the lovely renovations that would be done prior to our wedding taking place.  Pat said that the renovations would be done over the summer (well before my wedding would take place in June the following year).  A few months later (after little communication from my initial meeting with Pat) we had our food tasting.  The food tasting was an absolute disaster. From the food being disgusting and bland and tasting like high school cafeteria food, to receiving a $60 check afterwards because our mothers came.  We were completely livid.  But the icing on the cake was the zero renovations that still hadn't been done, months after we paid the deposit. The very next day I left Pat a voicemail and sent him an email.  I'm a paralegal, so I'm extremely thorough and attentive to detail.  I emailed Pat all of my correspondences with Melissa showing that she never stated that I couldn't bring our 2 freaking parents and asked for the full refund.  I also mentioned the renovations that he promised that clearly weren't ever done.  Pat became a completely different person.  He said the food tasting was only for the bride and groom.  I explained that it was never stated in any paperwork that it was complimentary for just the two of us.  Our mothers paid for the wedding, and I don't eat meat so I would like more than one person's review of this food.  I also asked how can you charge for additional food, when you still presented us with one plate for everyone to share.  He said it's their policy and no refund would be issued.  Then I asked about the renovations and why the venue looked exactly the same.  First, he acted as if he never made any promises about renovations, then after I kept asking several questions, he back tracked and said that it's hard to get the licenses for renovations in the county.  So basically, no renovations would be done prior to my wedding.  At this point I was absolutely livid.  First if you are going to nickel and dime me now for freaking $60 then this is going to be a long process.  Second, I would have never ever booked with that venue based on how it looked.  Everything in the ballroom looked outdated, the carpet was dingy and old, and the venue as a whole looked old, and I literally had stopped looking at venues based off the lies Pat had told us. So, I told Pat that I was unhappy and would rather book somewhere else and that I wanted my deposit back.  Initially, he said no.  Then when I threatened legal action, he gave us our deposit back immediately.
THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS DONT BOOK WITH PAXON HOLLOW. From Pat being a con artist, to Melissa they are just horrible and honestly seem as if they don't fully comprehend customer service.  Two weeks after firing Paxon Hollow, I booked with Regal Ballroom and we just got married on June 10th.  They were literally the polar opposite of Paxon Hollow. Netty, and Chris were so amazing and attentive. The food at the food tasting was amazing, we were allowed to bring our moms, the entire venue was brand new and by the wedding day they had even made some tweaks to the bridal suite, we were able to keep the same date as before, had a million times better customer service, and paid a lot less then Paxon Hollow.
